Description: Bayesian improved surname geocoding (BISG) is a ubiquitous tool 
    for predicting race and ethnicity using an individualâ€™s geolocation and 
    surname, however statistical dependence of surname and geolocation within 
    racial/ethnic categories in the United States results in biases for minority 
    subpopulations. Based on the method proposed by Greengard and Gelman (2025) 
    <doi:10.1093/jrsssa/qnaf003>, we augment the data used by traditional BISG 
    (distributions of race by geolocation and race by surname) with the 
    distribution of surname by geolocation obtained from state voter files. 
    We then use a raking-based algorithm to compute calibrated BISG (caliBISG) 
    predictions. caliBISG is easily interpretable, more accurate, and better 
    calibrated than traditional BISG.
