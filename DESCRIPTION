Description: Provides a raking-based improvement to Bayesian Improved Surname 
    Geocoding (BISG), as proposed by Greengard and Gelman (2024) 
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2304.09126>. 
    BISG is a ubiquitous tool for predicting race and ethnicity using an 
    individualâ€™s geolocation and surname, however statistical dependence of 
    surname and geolocation within racial/ethnic categories in the United States 
    results in biases for minority subpopulations. We augment the data used by 
    standard BISG (distributions of race by geolocation and race by surname) 
    with the distribution of surname by geolocation obtained from state voter 
    files. The result is easily interpretable, and is more accurate and better 
    calibrated than BISG.
